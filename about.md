Please note that Chicago BitDevs aims at a technical audience. A general expectation is that people are quite familiar with the design, security, and specification of Bitcoin. Everyone is welcome and we encourage newcomers to observe, but it is unlikely that we will spend time answering introductory questions.

Newcomers to bitcoin should make sure to check out the [Bitcoin & Open Blockchain meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-Open-Blockchain-Community-Chicago/)

You can also find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chibitdevs) and [Telegram](https://t.co/Hvt5MRb5br). Feel free to suggest topics for upcoming meetings.
