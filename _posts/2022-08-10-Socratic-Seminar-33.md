## Drivechain

This month we will focus on the drivechain proposal.  Drivechain is a sidechain
design, which aims to allow the transfer of bitcoin to and from another
application.  Some putative examples of drivechain applications are

- a sidechain with strong transaction and balance privacy
- a high-throughput sidechain with cheap transactions
- a prediction market sidechain

We will start with an overview of the proposal, then move on to a debate.

#### Debate Resolution

Activating BIP 300/301 would not significantly increase the risk of consensus
disruptions (such as more frequent or longer reorgs).
