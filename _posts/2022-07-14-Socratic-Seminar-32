**Discussion questions:** 

- To what extent does Bitcoin’s public ledger transparency and lack of default privacy undermine Bitcoin’s future adoption potential?
- Over time, continuing education and developments at the protocol and application levels can help with privacy concerns. How do you envision these practices evolving as Bitcoin adoption continues?
