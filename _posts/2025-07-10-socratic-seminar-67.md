## Presentation (Bold Bitcoin Wallet BBW)

A multi-party computation (MPC) threshold signature schemes (TSS) wallet.  
(over local LAN and over NOSTR)

It's not a cold wallet, nor a hot wallet. It's a warm wallet with multisig, but all TX are single sig.  
It allows multiple phones to create wallets with keyshares, and requires majority of participants to sign transactions.
