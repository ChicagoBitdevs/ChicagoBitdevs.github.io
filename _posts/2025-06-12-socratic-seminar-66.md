## OP_RETURN Relay Policy Changes Merged

Bitcoin Core has merged PR #32406 which updates relay policy to:
- uncap the OP_RETURN data size limit, previously set to 80 bytes
- allow multiple OP_RETURN outputs in a single transaction
- marks `-datacarrier` and `-datacarriersize` options as deprecated (but does not remove them)

This change will be included in Bitcoin Core v30.
