Coincenter's legal argument to why the Bank Secrecy Act is unconstitutional. This is a potential legal strategy to stop the regulatory onslaught against cryptocurrency developers. We talked about FINCEN's rule making proposal last week, this could potentially be a legal strategy to make regulators be enforcers of the law, not writers _and_ enforcers of the law.
