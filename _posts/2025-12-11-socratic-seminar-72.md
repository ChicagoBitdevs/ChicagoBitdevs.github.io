## Recap: First Ever DIY Signing Device Summit
see: https://x.com/Vinteum_org/status/1986161383193370724

The [Specter DIY](https://x.com/SpecterDIY), [SeedSigner](https://x.com/SeedSigner), and [Krux](https://x.com/selfcustodykrux) teams were all brought together for a DIY hardware summit in São Paulo Brazil last month, led by [Stepan Snigirev](https://x.com/StepanSnigirev). [CryptoGuide](https://x.com/YTCryptoGuide) was there to represent his SeedSigner + [Satochip](https://x.com/satochip) smartcard [fork](https://github.com/3rdIteration/seedsigner) as well as [Lawrence Nahum](https://x.com/LarryBitcoin) to share his deep knowledge of the Jade development.

## Hands-On DIY Signing Device Demos
We'll pass around Specter DIYs, SeedSigners, Kruxes, a Jade DIY, and even a SeedSigner+Satochip build with some demo seeds and testnet funds. Create watch-only wallets, review psbts, sign txs.

Open Q&A on the differences between them, use cases, risks, etc.
