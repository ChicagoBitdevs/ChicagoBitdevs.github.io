## Recap: First Ever DIY Signing Device Summit
see: https://x.com/Vinteum_org/status/1986161383193370724

The [Specter DIY](https://x.com/SpecterDIY), [SeedSigner](https://x.com/SeedSigner), and [Krux](https://x.com/selfcustodykrux) teams were all brought together for a DIY hardware summit in São Paulo Brazil last month, led by [Stepan Snigirev](https://x.com/StepanSnigirev). [CryptoGuide](https://x.com/YTCryptoGuide) was there to represent his SeedSigner + [Satochip](https://x.com/satochip) smartcard [fork](https://github.com/3rdIteration/seedsigner) as well as [Lawrence Nahum](https://x.com/LarryBitcoin) to share his deep knowledge of the Jade development.

## Chaincode Labs Bootcamp
"The ₿OSS Challenge is back 🎉
Start your career in bitcoin open source software (₿OSS) and change your life forever."

## DMND Launch
"The first FULLY #StratumV2 Bitcoin Mining Pool. Build your own BLOCK. Secure. Efficient. More ₿ for [[KYB]](https://x.com/DMND_Sv2/status/1995527443357041026) Miners." 

## Mujina Developer Preview Released
The firmware of the [EmberOne](https://github.com/256foundation/emberone00-pcb) open source hash system has been published. [Github](https://github.com/256foundation/mujina)

## Jua Kali Developer Preview Released 
[Gridless released a DC system](https://x.com/GridlessCompute/status/1996481192376533218)
"Jua Kali is an open-source project designed to run Bitcoin ASIC hashboards on direct DC power, such as from solar panels or batteries. This project provides the necessary hardware and software to create a more resilient and off-grid Bitcoin mining setup. This repository serves as the main entry point for the Jua Kali project, containing the hardware specifications and the software source code." [Github](https://github.com/GridlessCompute/Jua-Kali-Miner)

## An Independent Security Audit of Bitcoin Core
[The first public, third-party audit of Bitcoin Core](https://brink.dev/blog/2025/11/19/bitcoin-core-security-audit/)

## Building a vault using blinded co-signers
MuSig2 + ZKP Vault PoC
"Unlike traditional setups involving co-signers, this scheme uses a blinded version of Musig2 to ensure the signers learn as little as possible about the on-chain movements of the funds they are involved in co-signing."[Delving](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/building-a-vault-using-blinded-co-signers/2141)
[Github](https://github.com/halseth/blind-vault)

## The Cat - Non-monetary UTXO Cleanup
A bip [proposal](https://github.com/ostromcode/The-Cat) to make "designated Non Monetary UTXOs (NMUs) permanently unspendable... Once rendered unspendable, we will be removing these UTXOs made unspendable by consensus under this proposal, from the UTXO set..."

## Hash-based Signature Schemes for Bitcoin 
3-4kb quantum resistant signatures possible via performance tuning NIST libraries. 
The [report](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/2203.pdf) also discusses broader considerations:
1. Trade-offs between stateless and stateful schemes
2. Compatibility with HD wallets
3. Limitations of current approaches for multi- and threshold signatures
4. Security targets
   
[Announcement](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/2203.pdf)

## Motion to activate Bip 3
"This BIP replaces BIP 2 as the guideline for the BIP process."
[Murch](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/j4_toD-ofEc?pli=1)

## Bip89 assigned & Block championing
"We propose a new BIP for Chain Code Delegation, a collaborative custody technique that involves privileged participants (delegatee) withholding BIP32 chain codes at key setup time from a delegator, and sharing only enough information for non‑privileged participants to provide their signature." [Delving](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/chain-code-delegation-private-access-control-for-bitcoin-keys/1837)

## Hands-On DIY Signing Device Demos
We'll pass around Specter DIYs, SeedSigners, Kruxes, a Jade DIY, and even a SeedSigner+Satochip build with some demo seeds and testnet funds. Create watch-only wallets, review psbts, sign txs.

Open Q&A on the differences between them, use cases, risks, etc.
