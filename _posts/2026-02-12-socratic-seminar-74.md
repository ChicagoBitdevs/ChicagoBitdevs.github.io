## BIP 110 - Reduced Data Temporary Softfork Merged

Temporarily limit the size of data fields at the consensus level, in order to correct distorted incentives caused by standardizing support for arbitrary data, and to refocus priorities on improving Bitcoin as money.

BIP 110 reaches 5.9% of nodes signaling according to the following link

## BIP 346 - OP_TXHASH Merged

This opcode provides a generalized method for introspecting certain details of the spending transaction, which enables non-interactive enforcement of certain properties of the transaction spending a certain UTXO.

Together with an opcode like OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK, this opcode effectively provides a fully generalized signature hash construction, fully supporting all existing SIGHASH flags, the proposed sighash flags from BIP-118 (SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT) and many other new signature hash combinations.

## BIP 360 - Pay To Merkle Root (P2MR) Merged

This document proposes a new output type: Pay-to-Merkle-Root (P2MR), via a soft fork. P2MR outputs operate with nearly the same functionality as P2TR (Pay-to-Taproot) outputs, but with the key path spend removed.

## BIP 54 - Concensus Cleanup Implementation Merged into Bitcoin Inquisition

Initial implementation of BIP 54 - Concensus Cleanup has been merged into Bitcoin Inquisition (a fork of Bitcoin Core repo used to test initial implementation of soft forks)

#### Spain PM Vows to Tighten Grip on Social Media Platforms
Starting next week, my government will implement the following actions:
- First, we will change the law in Spain to hold platform executives legally accountable for many infringements taking place on their sites.
- Second, we will turn algorithmic manipulation and amplification of illegal content into a new criminal offense.
- Third, we will implement a hate and polarization footprint system to track, quantify, and expose how digital platforms fuel division and amplify hate.
- Fourth, Spain will ban access to social media for minors under the age of 16. Platforms will be required to implement effective age verification systems — not just checkboxes, but real barriers that work.
- Fifth and last, my government will work with our public prosecutor to investigate and pursue the infringement committed by Grok, TikTok, and Instagram.
