BIP 119 is not new, but since talk of activation ramped up a lot this month we are going to take the opportunity to go over it.  The main goals for the discussion are:

- understand use cases,
- estimate implementation and maintenance complexity,
- situate the proposal among alternatives, and
- go over considerations for activation and activation methods.

One interesting new feature is [CJDNS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/23.x/doc/cjdns.md) support.

Feedback received from attempting to activate bip 119. Jeremy will not try to activate bip119 via existing soft fork activation mechanisms in the near term future.
