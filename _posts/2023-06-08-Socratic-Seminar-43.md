## Ledger decides to publish a lot of source code early

<https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/11132311094813-Ledger-s-open-source-roadmap>

Ledger announced an opaque key sharding backup scheme tied to user IRL identities.  This was a miscalculation and the company was dragged by most all of the Bitcoin universe.  As a result, Ledger has decided to publish all of the source code they legally can, as well as a white paper for the key sharding scheme.

Ledger has cancelled the release of new firmware with support for the key-sharding scheme.
