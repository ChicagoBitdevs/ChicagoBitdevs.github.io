    Welcome! We meet once a month, typically on the second Thursday.

    <br />
    <br />
    The purpose of this meeting is to discuss topics of interest to developers
    working on software that touches bitcoin in some way. Free and open debate
    is critical to the health of the bitcoin community. We insist that attendees
    do not record audio, video, or still images of the meetup. Furthermore,
    please do not attribute remarks made in the meetup to individuals.
    <br />
    <br />
    Afterparty: Check out the upcoming meetup event for where we will go for
    drinks after the technical discussion.
